## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [react-copy-to-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard)

### What I learned

This was a good exercise for making reusable components with interactivity.  The project also enabled me to implement react-copy-to-clipboard library that I had never used and practice using the Fetch API to get the shortened URL.
